This is a Visualization I created in Tableau summing up the books I read in Sept 2020-2021.

I was gifted a kindle in September 2020 which made reading easier and more accessible. With the skills acquired through the Google Data Analytics certification, I created this visualization to get a better view of my reading throughout the year(right click and open in a new tab for a better look).

Below is a snap shot of what I read this year:
