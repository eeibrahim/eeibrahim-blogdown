This is a Visualization I created in Tableau summing up the books I read in Sept 2020-2021. 

I was gifted a kindle which made reading easier and more accessible. After completing the Google Data Analytics certification, this is a personal project I did to get a better view of my reading throughout the year.

  Below is a snap shot of what I read this year:
