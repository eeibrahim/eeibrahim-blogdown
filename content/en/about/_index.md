My name is Elfadil Ibrahim, I am a 3x Certified Salesforce Administrator and I built this site using  Rstudio (as well as netlify and Github) to showcase my abilities in R and Data Analytics more generally.
  
  My interest in Technology and computers formally started when I completed The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in 2021. That taught me the basics of R and SQL and Excel. Since then I transitioned into a career working with Data, primarily through Salesforce.
  
  Hope you enjoy the website and its contents.
