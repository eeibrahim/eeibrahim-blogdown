My name is Elfadil Ibrahim, I am a 3x Certified Salesforce Administrator and I built this site using  Rstudio (as well as netlify and Github) to showcase my abilities in Data Analytics and Salesforce.
  
My interest in computers formally started when I completed The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in 2021. Through that course I learned the basics of R, SQL and Excel. Since then I transitioned into a career working with Data as a Salesforce Administrator where I regularly use these skills to make my work easier and more interesting.
  
  Hope you enjoy following me on my journey of learning.
